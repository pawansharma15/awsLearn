Learn AWS Cloud formation template

The project contains series of steps for requesting resources using Cloud Formation Template, begining with creation of IAM user. This contains instructions to create accounts to be used by users while doing the hands on. I have created a Cloud formation template which would create 10 users at a time given. All the users would have the same password. The template creates uses in multiple of 10, so even if you want 11 users you have to create 10 users twice, which is 20 users.
